James Campbell:
I found a useful tool from W3Schools for finding a colour so if you don't know the name of a colour you want to use for a button or canvas you can use this tool:

Thanks.

Also, if you want to include sound in your project, just copy and paste the github link with your file, no need for the 'raw' in the url otherwise it wont be able to read it.
